# TokenAuthentication

- This authentication scheme uses a simple token-based HTTP authentication scheme. Token authentication is appropriate for client-server setups such as native desktop and mobile clients.

- To use the tokenAuthentication scheme you will need to configure the authentication classes to include TokenAuthentication and additional include rest_framework.authtoken in your INSTALLED_APPS setting:

```python

INSTALLED_APPS = [
  ...
  'rest_framework.authtoken',
]

```

- if successfully authenticated, TokenAuthentication provides the following credentials.

- request.user will be a django user instance.

- request.auth will be a rest_framework.authtoken.models.Token instance.

- Unauthenticated responses that are denied permission will result in an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response with an appropriate WWW-Authenticate header. For example:

> WWW-Authenticate:Token

- The http command line tool may be useful for testing token authenticated APIs. For example:

> http://127.0.0.1:8000/studentapi/'Authorization:Token9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0ebbfc6ee4b'

> If you use TokenAuthentication in production you must ensure that your API is only available over http.

## Generate Token

- Using Admin application
- Using Django manage.py command

  - python manage.py drf_create_token <username>: This command will return API Token for the given user or creates a Token if token dosen't exist for user.

- By exposing an API endpoint.
- Using signals

## How Client can Ask/Create Token

- when using TokenAuthentication you may want to provide a mechanism for client obtain a token given the username and password.

- REST framework provides a built-in view to provide this behavior. To use it, add the obtain_auth_token view to your URLconf:

```python
from rest_framework.authtoken.views import obtain_auth_token

urlpatterns = [
  path('gettoken/',obtain_auth_token)
]
```

- The obtain_auth_token view will return a JSON response when valid username and password field are posted to the view using from data or JSON:

> http POST https://localhost:8000/gettoken/username="name"password="pass"{'token':'9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0ebbfc6ee4b'}
